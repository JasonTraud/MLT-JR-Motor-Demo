# MLT-JR
The example code in this repository provide basic demonstrations of functions and to provide a base for your next project. 

If you have requests for additional code samples, please send them to info (at) SDRobots.com

## Motor Demo
Demonstrates motor movement by ramping the motors up and down in each direction. This is the demonstration code that is pre-programmed on all assembled MLT-JR Programmable Platforms (TP-230-002).

## Sensor Demo
Builds on the motor demo examply by adding an IR sensor to the front of the robot to perform basic object avoidance.
